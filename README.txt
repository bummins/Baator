Introduction
------------
The Nine Hells of Baator is hostile place filled with highly pressurized pockets of Gases and liquids, unbearably high temperatures yet some areas cold enough to liquify your own breath.
New and Unique challenges await where high risk comes with high rewards but be careful expanding or your home may quickly become unhospitable. 

Baator is a Large asteroid following a theme that closely resembles Dungeons and Dragons lore as a theme https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Nine_Hells
